# leela-chess-experimental
based on Leela Chess Zero https://github.com/LeelaChessZero

In order to familiarize myself with the code and get a feel for MCTS, i tried a number of search ideas in lc0. If you find something interesting here feel free to open an issue and discuss. This is a work in progress and purely experimental - new ideas will be added from time to time. This serves as documentation of both the good as well as the bad tries - so do not expect huge gains - but some ideas yield a measurable elo gain.  

Disclaimer: All changes are completely zero, completely game agnostic and need no parameters (except one). 

## Search Modifications

### Single-legal-move extension

For a decription and an example position of what this does see:
https://github.com/Videodr0me/leela-chess-experimental/wiki#single-legal-move-positions---auto-extend1

10.000 Game self-play result:
```
tournamentstatus final P1: +2974 -2925 =4101 Win: 50.24% Elo:  1.70 LOS: 73.82% P1-W: +1705 -1267 =2028 P1-B: +1269 -1658 =2073
```

Result is within expectations, as this minor change takes probably 100.000 games to properly assess.

### Certainty propagation 

This is also known as MCTS-Solver or Proof-Number-Search in literature. For a description with example positions see: https://github.com/Videodr0me/leela-chess-experimental/wiki#certainty-propagation---certainty-prop1

```
tournamentstatus final P1: +2937 -2849 =4214 Win: 50.44% Elo:  3.06 LOS: 87.63% P1-W: +1718 -1140 =2142 P1-B: +1219 -1709 =2072
```

Result is also within expectation, but this has some nice properties. Certain winning moves at root can be played regardless of visit counts, which is beneficial in time pressure situations as MCTS is slow to revise initial estimates. Also if one day Tablebases get added, certainty propagation is useful for propagating the TB probe results throughout the tree. 

### Moving-Average-Q
Power function was to steep for high visit searches - did not scale well. Linear version testing...

This is my flavor of Gudmundsson and Bj√∂rnsson 2011. For a description with example position see:

## Validation run 1

10.000 game validation run with all three options enabled (uncertainty-prop=1, auto-extend=1, backpropagate-gamma=0.75)
```
tournamentstatus final P1: +3220 -2343 =4437 Win: 54.39% Elo: 30.55 LOS: 100.00% P1-W: +1721 -1184 =2095 P1-B: +1499 -1159 =2342
```
Result confirms above single option results and strength contributions seem additive.
