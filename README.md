# leela-chess-experimental
based on Leela Chess Zero https://github.com/LeelaChessZero

Update 17/06/2018: New source, new executable, new parameters and new test results.

I tried a number of MCTS search ideas in lc0. If you find something interesting here feel free to open an issue and discuss. This is a work in progress and purely experimental - new ideas will be added from time to time. This serves as documentation of both the good as well as the bad tries - so do not expect huge gains - but some ideas yield a measurable elo gain.  

Disclaimer: All changes are completely zero, completely game agnostic and need no parameters (except one). 

## Search Modifications

### Tree Balancing
The upper confidence bound used in LC0's UCT flavor (and that of A0) assumes that the confidence bound of a child node is not affected by the local branching factor. However, in some games like Draughts or Chess the number of legal moves (branches) can vary greatly even in the same part of the search tree. This modification is based on the idea that we can use the number of individual branches in relation to the average number of branches to adjust the upper bound when selecting child nodes for expansion.  

Initial testing with Parameters:

--tree-balance=1.5
--tree-balance-scale=1.5

at 800 visits per move in 1000 games yielded these results:
```
P1: +212 -122 =666 Win: 54.50% Elo: 31.35 LOS: 100.00% P1-W: +126 -49 =325 P1-B: +86 -73 =341
```
But more testing is needed at higher visit searches. More results will follow.
  

### Certainty propagation & Single-legal-move extension

A variant of MCTS-Solver (Winands et. al). For a decription, example positions and self-play elo see:

https://github.com/Videodr0me/leela-chess-experimental/wiki/MCTS-Solver---Certainty-Propagation-and-Autoextending

```
P1: +181 -152 =667 Win: 51.45% Elo: 10.08 LOS: 94.40% P1-W: +102 -69 =328 P1-B: +79 -83 =339
```
Besides the small gain of elo, this has some additonal nice properties. Leela now finds shallow mates faster and certain winning moves at root can be played regardless of visit counts, which is beneficial in time pressure situations (typically MCTS is slow to revise initial estimates).

### Compress low policy move probabilites
Instead of changing softmax temperature this scheme encourages exploration of low policy priors by compressing low probabilites more than high probabilites in relation to search depths. This does well at tactics (>170/200 WAC Silvertestsuite with standard cpuct=1.2) but suffers somewhat in selfplay, even though results against different opponents (non leela) are better. Might be useful for long analysis as it restores MCTS convergence properties (under some circumstances leela would never find moves no matter how many nodes visited.). 
```
-- policy-compression=0.0 (disabled)
---policy-compression=0.1 (medium)
---policy-compression=0.2 (strong)
```
### Easy Early Visits:
Tweaks the formula slightly to encourage early visits. The confidence bound is asymptotically unchanged but second and to a lesser degree third visits are more probable.
```
--easy-early-visits=0 (disabled)
--easy-early-visits=1 (enabled)
```
Might help ever so slightly tactically - this is untested but might work well in conjunction with policy compression. Self-play might suffer, but untested against non-leela opponents. 

### Q-Moving-Average
Tested some variants of Gudmundsson and Bj√∂rnsson and Feldman and Domshlak. For a description see:

https://github.com/Videodr0me/leela-chess-experimental/wiki/Backpropagation:-Q-Moving-Average

Large elo gains at low visit counts, but doesn't currently scale with larger visit searches. Interesting but needs further investigation.

### Do not trust initial visits q (fully)
Similar to FPU this assumes that when selecting nodes for expansion that first backpropagated NN eval is still unreliable and gets averaged with parent-q for PUCT evaluation. Details of multiple flavours here:

https://github.com/Videodr0me/leela-chess-experimental/wiki/Selection:-Don't-trust-initial-visits

Inconclusive results or elo losses. Could not make this work.


### UCB1 tuned and other variance based approaches

Variance of q is calculated for each node. And used for node selection. Work in progress: variances are calculated with a numerically robust "online" algorithm. Use --verbose-movestats to display variances for each node. These stats are very interesting, next is to use this info in a theoretically sound way in the PUCT formula.

## Validation Runs

### Run for Leela MCTS Experimental v2
coming soon

### Run for Leela MCTS Experimental v1

10.000 game (100 visits per move) validation run with these options enabled (uncertainty-prop=1, auto-extend=1, backpropagate-gamma=0.75)
```
tournamentstatus final P1: +3220 -2343 =4437 Win: 54.39% Elo: 30.55 LOS: 100.00% P1-W: +1721 -1184 =2095 P1-B: +1499 -1159 =2342
```
Unfortunately backpropagate-gamma does not scale for larger visit searches. Certainty-propagation has been improved since the above match. The next validation run with all modifications that gain elo will be done as soon as testing of new schemes is complete.


## Miscellaneous
A number of "sanity tests" of FPU variants, Cpuct and various minor MCTS tweaks can be found here. These are mainly done to corroborate that current leela is working as expected and to restest some minor implementation details in chess:

### Notes
Test parameters were old default cpuct=1.2, fpu-reduction=0.0, and NN 5d46d9c438a6901e7cd8ebfde15ec00117119cabfcd528d4ce5f568243ded5ee

For test positions threads=1 and batchsize=1 were used for reproducability.
